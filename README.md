Hello!

  Please note that most of the projects contained in this repository are dependent on the repository “anfrench/pcllib” 
as well as the point cloud library. Clone the anfrench/pcllib here and download/install the point cloud library from :
http://pointclouds.org/downloads/

  To compile the code (as is) make a directory called “pclLib” in the same folder as the source code and clone the pcllib to that directory.
Otherwise make sure to edit the #includes appropriately so that the compiler can find where you put the necessary files.
